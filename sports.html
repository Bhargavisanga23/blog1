Malaysia has secured the prestigious Thomas Cup, the ultimate prize in men’s international team badminton, on five occasions in its history.

	<img src="https://statjunction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-5-min-800x445.jpg"></img>
    <p>The diamond league meet in Paris also known as Meeting de Paris is the fourth meeting that took place in the city of Paris. The event included a total of 15 competitions which were distributed across men’s (6) and women’s (9) categories. The fourth leg of the tournament saw many important athletes not in the middle of the competition. However, in the absence of these regular faces, many new candidates emerged in the middle. The Diamond League will now shift its course to Oslo which will take place on June 15, 2023. The Diamond League will conclude on September 17, 2023, with the final taking place in Hayward Stadium, Eugene, Oregon (United States).

Highlights from the Diamond League Paris 2023
India’s Murali Sreeshankar registered an impressive 8.09m attempt to finish third in the men’s long jump event at the Paris Diamond League 2023 athletics in France. Greece’s Olympic champion, Miltiadis Tentoglou took the gold in Paris with 8.13 m while Switzerland’s Simon Ehammer, last year’s World’s bronze medallist came second with 8.11 m. In the men’s 100 m sprint, Noah Lyles dashed all hopes of Ferdinand Omanyala from Kenya to win the gold medal. The Kenyan was 0.01 seconds slower than the American. Grant Holloway (USA), the silver medalist in Rabat came back strongly in Prais to finish first in the event.

In the women’s 400 m field, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone has put on an alert that she’s here to challenge the best. At the Paris Diamond League athletics meet, the American 400m hurdles world record holder sent a loud message, starting fast out of the blocks in her first flat lap race in nearly five years. However, the Dominican Republic’s Marileidy Paulino, the world and Olympic silver medallist, caught McLaughlin-Levrone down the final bend before pulling ahead on the straight to take victory in a meeting record 49.12. In Women’s Shot Put, Portugal’s Auriol Dongmo (19.72 m) was able to wade off the threat from American Shot putters. Tournament favourite Chase Ealey came second with a throw of 19.43 m while her compatriot Maggie Ewen came third with 19.26 m.

Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon set a new women’s 1500m world record barely a week ago, stepped up again in the 5000m and took on the world record holder, Letesenbet Gidey. The two pulled away quickly before Kipyegon made her move with two laps to go, moving ahead of her Ethiopian rival. Another record which was set was by the Norwegian Jakob Ingebrigtsen in men’s 2 miles which was last broken 26 years ago.

<h2>F1 track statistics: All you need to know about the Interlagos circuit</h2>
<img src="https://statjunction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Interlagosd-compressed-800x445.jpg" </img>
<p>The Autódromo José Carlos Pace, also known as Interlagos, is a 4.309 km (2.677 mi) motorsport circuit located in the neighbourhood of Interlagos in the city of So Paulo. Adhemar de Barros, a federal intervener, inaugurated it on May 12, 1940. The circuit’s and the neighborhood’s traditional names derive from the fact that they are situated between two large artificial lakes, Guarapiranga and Billings, which were built at the beginning of the twentieth century to supply the city with water and electricity. The circuit was renamed in 1985 to honour Formula One driver José Carlos Pace, who died in a plane crash in 1977.

It is famous for hosting the Formula 1 Brazilian Grand Prix and the Lollapalooza music festival. Since 1973, it has hosted the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix. It also hosted the 1992 Brazilian motorcycle Grand Prix, the 1996 Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft, the 2010 FIA GT1 World Championship, and the 2012 to 2014 FIA World Endurance Championship. As the country’s main racecourse, it has also hosted a number of previous and ongoing national championships, including Stock Car Brasil, Campeonato Sudamericano de GT, Fórmula Truck, Copa Truck, Formula 3 Sudamericana, Brazilian Formula Three Championship, and Mil Milhas Brasil. The venue also hosted the Prova Ciclstica 9 de Julho road cycling race.

The land on which the circuit is built was purchased in 1926 by property developers looking to build housing.[1] Due to difficulties, including the 1929 stock market crash, it was decided to construct a racing circuit instead; construction began in 1938, and the track was inaugurated on May 12, 1940. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Roosevelt Raceway (1937 layout) in the United States, Brooklands in England, and Montlhéry in France inspired the design. The circuit’s traditional name derives from its location in the Interlagos neighbourhood, which is situated between two large artificial lakes, Guarapiranga and Billings, which were built in the early twentieth century to supply the city with water and electricity.
